## Aalto Gamers ry

Aalto Gamers is a community of gamers from Aalto University. We organize both high-quality larger scale esports events as well as casual gaming nights for all university students. We bring together a diverse group of students from multiple different disciplines and schools. Above all, we aim to create a vibrant community for our players, universities and partners by building an environment where people can connect through gaming. Aalto Gamers is a non-profit organization founded in 2016 by a group of enthusiastic university students. Aalto Gamers is the largest student esports organization in Finland.

## Our mission

Our ultimate goal is to give students a gaming community and make it easier for all to join regardless of their level or frequency of gaming. We want to make gaming a channel to connect with others and find like-minded peole. Through tournaments and events we wish to bring value in gaming and let each member find their own community.
