Biweeklies are relaxed gaming nights organised every other Friday at 18 and onwards.

At biweeklies, you can count on having fun and making new friends.
At biweeklies we play all kinds of games: League of Legends, Overwatch 2, Valorant, CS:GO, Fall Guys, Among Us, Geoguessr, Minecraft and many more!
So don't be shy to join, even if your main game was not on the list. You can even bring your friends to challenge other Biweekly people!

You can join biweeklies at our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/Ew7nGQqHgc) or live at the Tribe gamebase in Otaniemi. Join our [Telegram channel](https://t.me/AaltoGamersAnnouncements) to stay up to date on the latest news about biweeklies.
