Aalto Gamers was founded in 2016 and has grown to become the biggest student e-sports and gaming organisation in Finland.
We organise high quality tournaments as well as more casual gaming nights (and much more).

Ultimately, our mission is to build a gaming community, where students can connect through gaming.
We want to reach every player regardless whether they have just started gaming or have played for their whole life.
