### Proximity voice chat (optional, but recommended)

For a more social experience, we use the [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat) mod.

#### Install instructions (takes about 5 min)

1. Download the [Fabric Mod loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
2. Run the "fabric-installer-1.0.0.exe"
3. Select Client, MC version **1.21.4**, Loader version **0.16.10**, launcher location as is (...\Roaming\.minecraft), check "create profile" and click "Install"
4. Download the [Simple Voice chat mod (Fabric v. 1.24.1.)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat/files/6239774)
5. Move the "voicechat-fabric-1.24.1-2.5.28.jar" to the Fabric mods folder
   *How to find the mods folder*
    Option 1 - From launcher:
    Minecraft launcher -> select "Installations" -> Folder icon next to "Play" on the right, -> select "mods" folder)
   Option 2 - Using file manager:
    Windows: %AppData%/.minecraft/mods
    Mac: \~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods
    Linux: \~/.minecraft/mods
6. Select "fabric-loader-1.24.1" in the Minecraft launcher and click "Play"

#### Using the mod

In game you can press "v" to edit your voice chat settings. You can use the proximity voice chat, and have groups so you can talk with our friends even if they are far away. We recommend making an "Open" group with your friends, so you can talk with our friends and as well as other people.
