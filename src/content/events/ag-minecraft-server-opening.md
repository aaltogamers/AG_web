**If you’ve been thinking, “Maybe I’ll play MC again someday” this is that day.** 

💎 A brand-new world awaits! Come build your own home around a shared spawn area, creating a cozy village vibe that grows over time, or chill and explore at your own pace, you decide! 🏡✨

We will also have a **server release item collection bingo after the server opening**, where you can show your speedrun mastery and win item prizes. 
The clock starts a moment after we launch! ⏰ 

The End is sealed, but not for long... We need YOU to gear up and rally your allies in a fight to help us free the end. ⚔ 

The battle is coming soon, stay tuned 🐉

\---------------------------------------------------

The server will run on the latest Java release (1.21.11) with some Quality-of-Life plugins, and no additional downloads are required. It will launch on Sunday, 1.3. at 13⏳. 

**The server requires being whitelisted to access.** The whitelist is only for bot prevention, and everyone gets whitelisted automatically through [here](aaltogamers.fi/whitelist) or through our Discord channel: discord.gg/aaltogamers

Rules: 

1. Be civil. No harassment or toxicity. Contact our Discord staff if needed in the mc-admin-contact channel.
2. No griefing. Do not sabotage others.
3. No stealing. If it’s not yours, don’t take it.
4. No hacking or use of egregious exploits (carpet duping, for example, is allowed). If you are unsure you can ask the admins.

Notes: 

Breaking the rules may result in a ban

For a more social experience, we recommend the Simple Voice Chat mod.
