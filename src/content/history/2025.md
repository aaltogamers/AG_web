In 2025, AG acquired the former "OK20 small guest house" from AYY, and turned it into a club room for it's members. This club room was later named "Spawn". Having a club room finally realized AG's long term goal of having a permanent space where AG members could hang out & we could produce events from.

When we first got the club room, it was not a very inviting space.

However, with the power of AG board members and actives, the space was renovated one step at a time. The less-than-optimal concrete floor was covered with cozy vinyl planks, and all the walls were scrubbed clean.

Most of the furniture was bought from friends, Otaniemi buy & sell or countless hours of searching Tori.fi. Bit by bit, the club room was renovated and furnished to be a nice and cozy "living room" for AG members to enjoy.

After being finished, the club room could be used for casual hanguouts, as well as full fledged streaming productions. The club room was used the Minecraft hunger games tournament, AG activity days, OSM 2025 qualifiers and much more!
