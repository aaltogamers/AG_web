When we first got the club room, it was not a very inviting space. However, with the power of AG board members and actives, the space was renovated one step at a time.

Most of the furniture was bought from friends, Otaniemi buy & sell or countless hours of searching Tori.fi. Bit by bit, the club room was renovated and furnished to be a nice and cozy "living room" for AG members to enjoy.
