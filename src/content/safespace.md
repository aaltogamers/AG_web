AG's events have zero tolerance for all forms of harassment, sexism, racism, bullying and
discrimination. In addition to major gestures and issues, harassment can also include minor
practices. Harassment may include verbal harassment, touching or staring. If someone asks a
person to stop harassing behaviour, they must stop. We want everyone to be able to participate in
the activities as themselves and feel safe.

- If you see or experience inappropriate conduct, you have the right to intervene in the
  situation. If you wish, you can also get in touch with AG's harassment contact persons or
  advise the person to get in touch.
- If you are criticised for your own actions, please have a constructive attitude.
- Remember the shared responsibility of the community to make our environment safe for all.
- Consider and respect the boundaries of others. Everyone’s identity is determined by
  themselves, and no one’s gender, sexual or political orientation, or nationality can be deduced
  from their appearance.
- Respect others and strive to take into account the diversity of the community and the diversity
  of individuals. Avoid making assumptions about others, as you cannot know the experiences,
  thoughts, life situation, or self-defined identity of others. However, we tend to make
  assumptions about others and therefore we should try to be aware of our own assumptions.
- Give space to others and make sure everyone is heard and involved. Accept the fact that not
  everyone wants to be the centre of attention, and that there are many ways to participate.
- Pay attention to the people around you. Care about how they are doing, how they are feeling,
  and how your words and actions affect them.
- Respect the physical and mental integrity of others. No means no; do not harass anyone
  verbally, or by touching or staring.
- Do not pressure anyone to use alcohol or other substances.
- Contribute to a positive atmosphere through your own actions
- Gaming can get heated. A little trash talk can be fine, but take into account the person you're talking to, and don't continue if you're making them feel uncomfortable.

Anyone who goes against this policy or the event-specific rules set by the AG board, can in serious cases be removed from the event and receive a ban from future events.

Event participants can always contact our harassment contact persons or board members by talking to them directly, or through messaging on Discord/Telegram/email.
